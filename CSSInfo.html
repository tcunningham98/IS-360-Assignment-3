        <h2 id="#whatis">What is CSS?</h2>
        <p>
            CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors,
            layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of
            devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of
            HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML
            from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages, and
            tailor pages to different environments. This is referred to as the separation
            of structure (or: content) from presentation.

            This document collects together into one definition all the specs that together form the
            current state of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) as of 2018. The primary audience is CSS
            implementers, not CSS authors, as this definition includes modules by specification
            stability, not Web browser adoption rate.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            When the first CSS specification was published,
            all of CSS was contained in one document that defined CSS Level 1.
            CSS Level 2 was defined also by a single, multi-chapter document.
            However for CSS beyond Level 2,
            the CSS Working Group chose to adopt a modular approach,
            where each module defines a part of CSS,
            rather than to define a single monolithic specification.
            This breaks the specification into more manageable chunks
            and allows more immediate, incremental improvement to CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since different CSS modules are at different levels of stability,
            the CSS Working Group has chosen to publish this profile
            to define the current scope and state of Cascading Style Sheets as of mid 2018.
            This profile includes only specifications that we consider stable <em>and</em> for which we
            have enough implementation experience that we are sure of that stability.
        </p>

        <p class="note" role="note">
            <span>Note:</span> This is not intended to be a CSS Desktop Browser Profile:
            inclusion in this profile is based on feature stability only
            and not on expected use or Web browser adoption.
            This profile defines CSS in its most complete form.
        </p>
        <p class="note" role="note">
            <span>Note:</span> Although we don’t anticipate significant changes to the
            specifications that form this snapshot,
            their inclusion does not mean they are frozen.
            The Working Group will continue to address problems as they are found in these specs.
            Implementers should monitor
            <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/">www-style</a> and/or
            the <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/CSS">CSS Working Group Blog</a> for any resulting changes, corrections, or clarifications.
        </p>

        <p><em>This section is non-normative.</em></p>
        <p>
            In the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/">W3C Process</a>,
            a Recommendation-track document passes through three levels of stability,
            summarized below:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Working Draft (WD)
            <dd>
                <p>
                    This is the design phase of a W3C spec.
                    The WG iterates the spec in response to internal and external feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first official Working Draft is designated the “First Public Working Draft” (FPWD).
                    In the CSSWG, publishing FPWD indicates that the Working Group as a whole
                    has agreed to work on the module, roughly as scoped out and proposed in the
                    editor’s draft.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The transition to the next stage is sometimes called “Last Call Working
                    Draft” (LCWD) phase. The CSSWG transitions Working Drafts once we have resolved all known issues,
                    and can make no further progress without feedback from building tests and
                    implementations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This “Last Call for Comments” sets a deadline for reporting any outstanding
                    issues,
                    and requires the WG to specially track and address incoming feedback.
                    The comment-tracking document is the Disposition of Comments (DoC).
                    It is submitted along with an updated draft for the Director’s approval,
                    to demonstrate wide review and acceptance.
                </p>
            <dt>Candidate Recommendation (CR)
            <dd>
                This is the testing phase of a W3C spec.
                Notably, this phase is about using tests and implementations to test the
                specification: it is not about testing the implementations.
                This process often reveals more problems with the spec,
                and so a Candidate Recommendation will morph over time in response to
                implementation and testing feedback, though usually less so than during the
                design phase (WD).
                <p>
                    Demonstration of two correct, independent implementations of each feature
                    is required to exit CR, so in this phase the WG builds a test suite and
                    generates implementation reports.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The transition to the next stage is “Proposed Recommendation” (PR).
                    During this phase the W3C Advisory Committee must approve the transition
                    to REC.
                </p>
            <dt>Recommendation (REC)
            <dd>
                This is the completed state of a W3C spec and represents a maintenance phase.
                At this point the WG only maintains an errata document
                and occasionally publishes an updated edition that incorporates the errata back
                into the spec.
        </dl>

        <h2 id="csslevels">CSS Levels</h2>

        <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets does not have versions in the traditional sense;
            instead it has <strong>levels</strong>
            Each level of CSS builds on the previous,
            refining definitions and adding features. The feature set of each higher
            level is a superset of any lower level, and the behavior allowed for a given
            feature in a higher level is a subset of that allowed in the lower levels.
            A user agent conforming to a higher level of CSS is thus also conformant to
            all lower levels.
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt><dfn>CSS Level 1</dfn>
            <dd>
                The CSS Working Group considers the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-CSS1-20080411/">CSS1 specification</a> to be
                obsolete. <a>CSS Level 1</a> is defined as all the features defined
                in the CSS1 specification (properties, values, at-rules, etc), but using
                the syntax and definitions in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/">CSS2.1 specification</a>.
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-style-attr/">CSS Style Attributes</a> defines its inclusion in
                element-specific style attributes.
            <dt><dfn>CSS Level 2</dfn>
            <dd>
                Although the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-CSS2-20080411/">CSS2 specification</a> is
                technically a W3C Recommendation, it passed into the Recommendation stage
                before the W3C had defined the Candidate Recommendation stage. Over time
                implementation experience and further review has brought to light many problems
                in the CSS2 specification, so instead of expanding an already
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/css2-updates/REC-CSS2-19980512-errata.html">
                    unwieldy
                    errata list
                </a>, the CSS Working Group chose to define <cite>
                    CSS Level 2 Revision 1
                </cite> (CSS2.1). In case of any conflict between the two specs
                CSS2.1 contains the definitive definition.
                <p>
                    Once CSS2.1 became Candidate Recommendation—effectively though not
                    officially the same level of stability as CSS2—obsoleted the CSS2
                    Recommendation.  Features in CSS2 that were dropped from CSS2.1 should be
                    considered to be at the Candidate Recommendation stage, but note that many
                    of these have been or will be pulled into a CSS Level 3 working draft, in
                    which case that specification will, once it reaches CR, obsolete the
                    definitions in CSS2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/">CSS2.1 specification</a> defines
                    <a>CSS Level 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-style-attr/">
                        CSS
                        Style Attributes specification
                    </a> defines its inclusion in
                    element-specific style attributes.
                </p>
            <dt><dfn>CSS Level 3</dfn>
            <dd>
                <a>CSS Level 3</a> builds on CSS Level 2 module by module, using the CSS2.1
                specification as its core. Each module adds functionality and/or
                replaces part of the CSS2.1 specification. The CSS Working Group
                intends that the new CSS modules will not contradict the CSS2.1
                specification: only that they will add functionality and refine
                definitions. As each module is completed, it will be plugged in to
                the existing system of CSS2.1 plus previously-completed modules.
                <p>
                    From this level on modules are levelled independently: for example
                    Selectors Level 4 may well be completed before CSS Line Module Level 3.
                    Modules with no <a>CSS Level 2</a> equivalent start at Level 1;
                    modules that update features that existed in <span>CSS Level 2</span> start at Level 3.
                </p>
            <dt><dfn>CSS Level 4</dfn> and beyond
            <dd>
                There is no CSS Level 4.
                Independent modules can reach level 4 or beyond,
                but CSS the language no longer has levels.
                ("CSS Level 3" as a term is used only to differentiate it from the previous monolithic versions.)
